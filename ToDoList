List of things to do:

1) Paper 1: QC metrics
  a) provide outline (Send outline)

  c) 
  
2) Proposal  
  a) Proportionality for co-expression analysis
  b) QC metrics
  c) Classification??  Is this even impacted by compositions (yes if correlation or distance measure)
    i) sparse CCA 
  
3) Paper 2: introduction to relative abundance and why that leads to compositions
  A) outline
  a) prove that relative abundance data is, in fact, a composition
  b) describe all the consequences thereof

  d) Aimed at biologists with motivating examples
  e) get buy-in from committee members
  
4) Paper 3: LDA with logistic normal distribution, 
  a) check if someone has done this already
  b) compositional variable selection: ignore groups or amalgamate
  c) can we use subcompositional independence somehow
