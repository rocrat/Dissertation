       <b>Figure 1:</b> Changes to the absolute abundance of a single transcript changes the relative abundance of the other transcripts being measured due to a total sum constraint. Ignoring the constraints imposed by compositional data can lead to spurious results.

       <b>Figure 2:</b> This animation shows the spurious results one might obtain from relative abundance data if it were treated as absolute abundance data.  As opposed to identifying the 1 true up-regulated mRNA, the observer would also incorectly identify the other 3 mRNA as down-regulated.
