Dissertation Notes:

Need objective measure of transformation
	Avoid fishing for best transformation based on results
	Discern optimal transformation among multiple "adequate" transformations assessed by visual measures

Need objective measure of transformation when visual methods break down
	High dimensionality
	
Is there a need to preserve interpret-ability of Y?

Notes From Dean Meetings:

Use amalgamations as a quality control metric as opoosed to a discovery tool.  
Look in appendx of billheimer 2001 for the simplex derivation of the distance
	show that angles then make sense so that we can say it is iterpretable in the same way (if in fact it is interpretable in the same way)
	Probes that I care about vs probes that I don't care about.
		make sure the genes I want to be expressing are expressing
		change read depth experimentally on control samples to find LOD
		statistical rule of thumb for read depth e.g. 3/n - use jefferies prior and estimate 

Get time series data used in Lovell paper 

Formalize the biplot evaluation and a statistical model for the amalgamations
CCLasso as an idea for genes that share a common pathway (like a phylogeny but ofr pathways)

What are the different ways that a run or sample could fail and ow can we leverage compositions to detect this%how can we apply a metric on a per sample basis%can HTG data be made publicly available

Can we find publicly available targeted data 

Are the reproducibility study data is free to share publicly
	See what sort of restrictions I would have.

Identify groups of interest somehow?

Heterogenity measure within amalgamation <- select groups based on minimum heterogeneity??

R package GlobalTest ^|^(above) might be adapted to compositions

Prove I_D -1_Dj_dJ_D' is a projection matrix (or not ) <- inverse is a projection (not sure wether it is orthognal)

%Do we need to have a written comprehensive exam?? Ask Michael
%Need to develop an outline
%Commitee:  Ed, ChengCheng, Melanie, Bonnie (ask if she wants to direct the commitee)
%

%More research on PCA!!
%look into tangent spaces 
%Document the connection between euclidean and clr geometry
