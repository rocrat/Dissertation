List of things to do in order of priority:

Write up the goodness of fit work that I did for the next meeting (Oct. 27th)

Figure out how to simulate the logistic normal (hint log-normal to logistic normal by dividing by the sum.)

1) Paper 1: QC metrics
  a) provide outline (Send outline)
  b) set up meeting 
  c) Provide draft
  
2) Proposal 
  A) Introduction to the problem:  RNA-seq is compositional
  B) Background of compositional data analysis (literature review)
  C) Proposed work: (pick 3 but first flesh out each slightly)
    i) QC metrics
    ii) Proportionality for co-expression analysis
    iii) Classification
    iv) introduction to relative abundance and why that leads to compositions
    v) Classification with the logistic normal distribution
    vi) Telescoping almalgamations (cross product of amalgamated probes with co-variate of composition)
    
3) Form committee and take Comprehensive exam
  
4) Paper 2: introduction to relative abundance and why that leads to compositions
  A) outline
    a) prove that relative abundance data is, in fact, a composition
    b) describe all the consequences thereof
    c) if you have all pair-wise ratios then you have all the information of a composition
    d) Aimed at biologists with motivating examples
    e) get buy-in from committee members
  
5) Paper 3: Classification with the logistic normal distribution 
  A) differences in distance and correlation metrics
  a) check if someone has done this already
  b) compositional variable selection: ignore groups or amalgamate
  c) Use ALKPlus ros/ret as a data set for this
      i) using the 5-prime as a 'housekeeper'
  d) clarify the ties between logistic normal and LDA 
  
  
6) Proportionality 

7) Telescoping almalgamations (cross product of amalgamated probes with co-variate of composition)
