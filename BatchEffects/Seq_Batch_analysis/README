This tar file contains code and data to recreate the batch effect analysis 
in exome sequencing data described in Nat. Reviews ###. Running file seq_analysis.R prints
out information included in Table ## and creates the heatmap plot in Figure ## 
(seq-batch-effect.eps and seq-batch-effect.pdf).

Code included:
- seq_analysis.R: performs analyis and creates plots
- funcs.R: some utility functions

Data included:
- chr16_exons.rda: IRanges object containing exon annotation for chromsome 16
- relationships_w_pops_121708.txt: pedigree information for hapmap samples
- chr16_1KG_pilot3.tab: count data from 1k genomes pilot 3, chromosome 16, in 1kb bins
