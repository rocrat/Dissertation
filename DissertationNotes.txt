Dissertation Notes:

Need objective measure of transformation
	Avoid fishing for best transformation based on results
	Discern optimal transformation among multiple "adequate" transformations assessed by visual measures

Need objective measure of transformation when visual methods break down
	High dimensionality
	
Is there a need to preserve interpret-ability of Y?
