List of things to do in order of priority:

1) Paper 1: QC metrics
  a) provide outline (Send outline)
  b) set up meeting 
  c) Provide draft
  
2) Proposal 
  A) Introduction to the problem:  RNA-seq is compositional
  B) Background of compositional data analysis (literature review)
  C) Proposed work:
    i) QC metrics
    ii) Proportionality for co-expression analysis
    iii) Classification
    
3) Form committee and take Comprehensive exam
  
4) Paper 2: introduction to relative abundance and why that leads to compositions
  A) outline
    a) prove that relative abundance data is, in fact, a composition
    b) describe all the consequences thereof
    c) if you have all pair-wise ratios then you have all the information of a composition
    d) Aimed at biologists with motivating examples
    e) get buy-in from committee members
  
5) Paper 3: Classification with the logistic normal distribution 
  a) check if someone has done this already
  b) compositional variable selection: ignore groups or amalgamate
