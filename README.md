Meeting 9/3/15-
  %probably need more than technical replicates - need some kind of information to contsrain the problem
  start with understanding the modern normalization technologies limma DESeq2
%use multivariate response?  Take advantage of the multiple analytes measured simultaneously
%Look up multivariate calibration in the anlytical chemistry literature
%Measurement error models- "Errors-in-varaibles"
%Measurement error in non-linear models with mean variance issue in sequencing data
%There will be at least one question on measurement error models
%do probe features add information to help with calibration
%use normalization comparison paper to motivate the current exercise (avoid using outcome)
%Start by writing down model and figureing out how to estimate the parameters
%figure out the relationship between x and y without only using y!!

Major take Home: Get to know the calibration problem.
